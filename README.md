## Contents
1. Data Augmentation: We tested different data augmentation settings in the notebooks under the folder "DataAugment"
2. Baseline model (model #1): We created the first baseline model in "baseline.ipynb"
3. Learning rate testing: We test 3 different learning rate setting in "learning_rate.ipynb"
4. Model Architecture: We compare the three models we designed in the notebook "model_architecture.ipynb"
5. Final model: We trained our final model over 100 epochs in "Final_model.ipynb"
